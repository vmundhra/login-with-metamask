## Getting Started

The app is made out of a `backend` which is a REST API written in Express, and a `frontend` which is a React single-page application. It's really a demo, so I tried to use as few libraries as possible.

#### To start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
yarn install
yarn dev # Will reload the node app on file changes
```

The backend should be running on localhost:8000.

#### To start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start # Will refresh the page on file changes
```
